God, infinite in purpose,
faithful watchers in the temple
welcomed Christ to the Father’s house,
glimpsed the glory and the pain to come.
Give us the faith to wait and watch for you.
Give us the perception to recognise you.
Through Jesus Christ our Liberator,
who is alive and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever. Amen

God, steadfast in love and purpose,
your Son was not diverted from Jerusalem and the cross.
Amid all business and distraction keep us focussed on your purpose.
In times of uncertainty or anxiety, steady us.

in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever. Amen

Alleluia, God Eternal;
death cannot contain your glory,
nor our mind confine this mystery.
Give us faith’s insight,
free us from all fear,
and release in us the Risen Christ.
Through Jesus Christ our Liberator,
who is alive and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever. Amen

at the breaking of bread you are made known.
In the Sacrament we are fed
with the living bread.
Guide us to lives which revere and honour
your redeeming love.
For you are alive and reign with the Father
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever. Amen
For Collects for Thanksgiving for Holy Communion refer to FAS volume 2 page 948, or the

Provident Father,
you grant the Holy Spirit to all who call upon you;
may we so ask that we joyfully receive,
search that we may fully find,
and knock that the door of compassion is opened;
through Christ our Mediator,
who is alive and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
Amen.

in the humble Christ
you take the lowest place among us;

in the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;
through Jesus Christ our Liberator,
who is alive and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
Amen.

that supports us in all life’s difficulties;
may we be content to simply serve,
and, when our labours are done,
all gather as equals around your table;
through Jesus Christ our Liberator,
who is alive and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.

NOTES ON THE CALENDAR-TE MARAMATAKA, AND
PRECEDENCE IN LITURGICAL OBSERVANCE –
KUPU WHAKAMĀRAMA-KO TĒHEA TE RĀ O NGĀ RĀ
HĀKARI
General Synod made the following provisions for precedence in liturgical observance.
Sundays - Ngā Rātapu
All Sundays celebrate the paschal mystery of the death and resurrection of the Lord.
Nevertheless, they also reflect the character of the seasons in which they are set.
Principal Feasts - Ngā Rā Hākari
The principal feasts which are to be observed are:
Christmas Day - Te Rā Whānautanga o tō tātou Ariki, o te Karaiti – Baradin (Hindi)
The Naming of Jesus - Te Whakaingoatanga o Īhu - O le Faasuafaina o Iesu (Samoan)
The Epiphany - Te Whakaaturanga - ‘Aho ‘oe ‘eiki Hili ‘ae Epifane (Tongan)
The Baptism of Christ - Te Iriiringa o te Karaiti - Krist Ka Baptishma (Hindi)
The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple - Te Tapaenga o te Karaiti i te
Temepara - Na Vakacabori i Jisu, e na Vale ni Soro (Fijian)
The Annunciation of our Saviour to the Blessed Virgin Mary – Te Whakapuakitanga o tō tātou
Kaiwhakaora ki te Puhi Tapu ki a Meri - O le Fofogaina o te Taupou o Maria e uiga i le afio
mai o lo tatou Faaola (Samoan)
Easter Day - Te Rā o te Aranga - Tucake Tale (Fijian)
Ascension Day - Te Rā Kakenga - Koe ‘aho ‘oe Ha’ele hake (Tongan)
The Day of Pentecost - Te Rā o te Petekoha - Penitiko (Fijian)
Trinity Sunday - Te Rātapu o te Tokotoru - O le aso Sa o le Tasi Tolu Paia (Samoan)
The Transfiguration of the Beloved Son - Te Whakaahuakētanga o te Tama aroha - Koe Fakahaha ‘oe ‘Alo ‘Ofa’anga (Tongan)
All Saints’ Day - Te Rā o te Hunga Tapu Katoa - Santho Ka Din (Hindi)
On these days the holy communion is normally celebrated.
These days, and the liturgical provision for them, should not be displaced by any other celebration,
except that the Annunciation, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to the Monday following or, falling
between Palm Sunday / Rātapu Nikau and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, is transferred to the
Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.
Except in the case of Christmas Day and Easter Day, the celebration of the feast begins with Evening
Prayer on the day before the feast, and the collect at that Evening Prayer is that of the feast. In the
case of Christmas Eve / Te Rā i mua i te Rā Whānautanga and Easter Eve / Holy Saturday / Te Rā i mua
i te Aranga, there is proper liturgical provision, including a collect, for the Eve, and this is used at both
Morning and Evening Prayer.
In any year when there is a Second Sunday of Christmas, the Epiphany (6 January) may, for pastoral
reasons, be celebrated on that Sunday.
The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple is celebrated either on 2 February or on the Sunday falling
between 28 January and 3 February.
All Saints’ Day is celebrated on either 1 November or the Sunday falling between 30 October and 5
November; if the latter there may be a secondary celebration on 1 November.
151
Other Principal Holy Days - Ētahi atu Rā Tapu
Ash Wednesday / Te Wenerei Pungarehu and Maundy Thursday / Te Taite Mone are principal holy
days. On both these days the Holy Communion is normally celebrated.
Good Friday / Te Paraire Pai is a principal holy day.
These days, and the liturgical provision for them, should not be displaced by any other celebration.
Eastertide - Te Wā o te Aranga
The paschal character of the Great Fifty Days of Eastertide, from Easter Day to The Day of Pentecost,
should be celebrated throughout the season, and should not be displaced by other celebrations. Except
for a patronal or dedication festival, no festival may displace the celebration of Sunday as a memorial
of the resurrection, and no saint’s day may be celebrated in Easter Week.
The paschal character of the season should be retained on those weekdays when saints’ days are
celebrated.
The nine days after Ascension Day until Pentecost may be used as days of prayer and preparation to
celebrate the outpouring of the Spirit.
Festivals - Ngā Rā Whakamaharatanga o te hunga tapu i ngā Karaipiture
The festivals are:
The Conversion of St Paul / Te Whakatahuritanga o Paora Tapu (25 January)

St John, the Evangelist / Hoani Tapu te Kaituhi rongopai (27 December, or 6
May)
152
The Holy Innocents / Ngā Kōhungahunga Tapu (28 December, or 16 February)
These days, and the liturgical provision for them, are not usually displaced. For each day there is full
liturgical provision for the Holy Communion and for Morning and Evening Prayer.
Provision is also made for a first Evening Prayer on the day before the festival where this is required.
Festivals falling on a Sunday may be kept on that day or transferred to the Monday (or, at the discretion
of the minister, to the next suitable weekday). But a festival should not be celebrated on Sundays of
Advent, in Lent or of Eastertide. Festivals coinciding with a Principal Feast or Principal Holy Day are
transferred to the first available day.
The Baptism of Christ is only transferred when 6 January is a Sunday.
Christ the King is not transferred.
When St Joseph’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is
transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter or, if the Annunciation has already been
moved to that date, to the Tuesday following.
When St Mark’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is
transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.
The Thursday after Trinity Sunday may be observed as the Day of Thanksgiving for the Holy Communion
(sometimes known as Corpus Christi), and may be kept as a festival.
Local Celebrations - Ngā Rā Whakamaharatanga o ia Rohe
The celebration of the patron saint or the title of a church is kept either as a festival or as a principal
feast.
The Dedication Festival of a church is the anniversary of the date of its dedication or consecration. This
is kept either as a festival or as a principal feast. When the date of dedication is unknown, the Dedication
Festival may be observed on the first Sunday in October, or on the Last Sunday after Pentecost, or on
a suitable date chosen locally. Please refer to the entry on the first Sunday of October for suitable
readings at the Eucharist. [See also FAS.]
When kept as principal feasts, the Patronal and Dedication Festivals may be transferred to the nearest
Sunday, unless that day is already a principal feast or one of the following days: The First Sunday of
Advent, The Baptism of Christ, The First Sunday of Lent, The Fifth Sunday of Lent or Palm Sunday.
Harvest Thanksgiving may be celebrated on a Sunday and may replace the propers for that day,
provided it does not supersede any principal feast or festival.
In the calendar of the saints, diocesan, tribal and other local provision may be made to supplement The
Calendar - Te Maramataka.
Lesser Festivals - Ētahi atu Rā Hākari
Lesser festivals, which are listed in the calendar, are observed at the level appropriate to a particular
church. Each is provided with a collect, psalm and readings, which may supersede the collect of the
week and the daily eucharistic lectionary. The daily psalms and readings at Morning and Evening Prayer
are not usually superseded by those for lesser festivals, but at the minister’s discretion psalms and
readings provided on these days for the Holy Communion may be used at Morning and Evening Prayer.
153
The minister may be selective in the lesser festivals that are observed, and may also keep some or all
of them as ‘commemorations’.
When a lesser festival falls on a principal feast or holy day or on a festival, its celebration is normally
omitted for that year, but, where there is sufficient reason, it may, at the discretion of the minister, be
celebrated on the nearest available day.
Commemorations - Ētahi atu Rā Whakamaharatanga
Commemorations, which are listed in the calendar, are made by a mention in prayers of intercession
and thanksgiving. They are not provided with collect, psalm and readings, and do not replace the usual
weekday provision at either the Holy Communion or Morning and Evening Prayer.
The minister may be selective in the commemorations that are made.
A commemoration may be observed as a lesser festival, with liturgical provision from the common
material for holy men and women, only where there is an established celebration in the wider church
or where the day has a special local significance. In designating a commemoration as a ‘lesser festival’,
the minister must remember the need not to lose the spirit of the season, especially of Advent and Lent,
by too many celebrations that detract from its character.
Days of Self-Examination and Special Devotion - Ngā rā e whakairo ai te tangata ki a ia anō
me ngā īnoi pūmau
The weekdays of Lent and every Friday in the year are days of self-examination and special devotion,
except all principal feasts and festivals outside Lent and Fridays from Easter Day to Pentecost.
The eves of principal feasts are also appropriately kept as days of self-examination and special devotion
in preparation for the feast.
Days of Prayer for the Ministry of the Church and Ordinands (Ember Days) - Ngā rā īnoi mo
te mahi minita i roto i te Hāhi me te hunga i karangatia hei minita
Prayers are offered on the weekdays following the Day of Pentecost and the week preceding St Andrew’s
Day.
Days of Prayer for the Ministry of the Church and Ordinands (Ember Days) should be kept, under the
bishop’s directions, in the week before an ordination as days of prayer for those to be made deacon or
priest.
Ember Days may also be kept even when there is no ordination in the episcopal unit as more general
days of prayer for those who serve the Church in its various ministries, both ordained and lay, and for
vocations.
Traditionally they have been observed on the Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays within the weeks
before the Third Sunday of Advent, the Second Sunday of Lent and the Sundays nearest to 29 June and
29 September.
[For All the Saints provides a Proper with two sets of Collects: (a) for Deacons, Priests and those to be
ordained; and (b) for lay ministers with particular ministries in the Church.]
Days of Prayer for Industry, Science and Technology - Ngā īnoi mo ngā wāhi mahi, taha
taiao, pūtaiao taha tangata
[These are days in the month of May and provide an opportunity for prayers to be offered for God’s
guidance for those involved in Industry, Science, and Technology.]
154
Days of Prayer for the Care of Creation - Ngā rā īnoi kia tiakina ngā mea katoa i hanga
These are days on either side of the commemoration of St Francis of Assisi (4 October) and provide
opportunities for prayer to be offered for God’s blessing on the fruits and creatures of the earth, and
the stewardship of the environment. The readings are set out in October. [Collects are in FAS.]
Ordinary Time - He wā noa iho
Ordinary time is the period after the Feast of the Presentation of Christ until Shrove Tuesday, and from
the day after the Feast of Pentecost until the day before the First Sunday of Advent. During ordinary
time, there is no seasonal emphasis, except that the period between All Saints’ Day and the First Sunday
of Advent is observed as a time to celebrate and reflect upon the reign of Christ in earth and heaven.
Liturgical Colours - Ngā ritenga mo ngā kameta me ngā kākahu
Appropriate liturgical colours are suggested: they are not mandatory and traditional or local use may be
followed.
White is the colour for the festal periods from Christmas Day to the Presentation and from Easter Day
to Ascension Day, for Trinity Sunday, for festivals of Our Lord and the Blessed Virgin Mary, for All Saints’
Day, and for the festivals of those saints not venerated as martyrs, for the Feast of Dedication of a
church, at Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday and in thanksgiving for Holy Communion and Holy
Baptism. It is used for Marriages, and Baptisms. It may be used in preference to violet or black for
Funerals, and should be used at the Funeral of a Child.
Red is used during Holy Week (except at Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday), from the Friday after
Ascension Day to the Feast of Pentecost, may be used between All Saints’ Day and the eve of the First
Sunday of Advent (except where other provision is made), and is used for the feasts of those saints
venerated as martyrs. It is appropriate for any services which focus on the gift of the Holy Spirit, and is
therefore suitable for Confirmation and Ordination.
Violet is the colour for Advent and from Ash Wednesday until the day before Palm Sunday. It may be
used for Funerals and for the Commemoration of the Faithful Departed, although either black or white
may be preferred. A Lent array of unbleached linen is sometimes used as an alternative to violet, but
only from Ash Wednesday until the day before Palm Sunday.
Green is used from the day after the Presentation until Shrove Tuesday, and from the day after
Pentecost until the eve of All Saints’ Day, except when other provision is made.
Coloured hangings are traditionally removed for Good Friday and Easter Eve, but red is the colour for
the liturgy on Good Friday.
The colour for a particular service should reflect the predominant theme. If the collect, readings, etc.
on a lesser festival are those of the saint, then either red (for a martyr) or white is used; otherwise, the
colour of the season is retained.
155
PRECEDENCE IN LITURGICAL OBSERVANCE
General Synod made the following provisions for precedence in liturgical observance.
Sundays/Ngā Rātapu
All Sundays celebrate the paschal mystery of the death and resurrection of the Lord. Nevertheless, they
also reflect the character of the seasons in which they are set.
Principal Feasts/Ngā Rā Hākari
The following Principal Feasts are to be observed: Christmas Day, The Naming of Jesus, The Epiphany,
The Baptism of Christ, The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple, The Annunciation of our Saviour to the
Blessed Virgin Mary, Easter Day, Ascension Day, The Day of Pentecost, Trinity Sunday, The
Transfiguration of the Beloved Son, and All Saints’ Day. These are indicated in the The Lectionary by
the use of BOLD CAPITALS. On these days the Eucharist is normally celebrated. These days are not
normally displaced by any other celebration except in accord with the guidelines provided by General
Synod as indicated in The Lectionary. Except for Christmas Day and Easter Day (each of which has an
Eve, with its own collect etc) the celebration of each Principal Feast begins with Evening Prayer on the
day before the feast, and the collect at that office is that of the feast.
Other Principal Holy Days/Ētahi atu Rā Tapu
The following Principal Holy Days are to be observed: Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday and Good
Friday. These are also indicated in BOLD CAPITALS. These days should not be displaced by any
other celebration.
Eastertide/Te Wā o te Aranga
The paschal character of the Great Fifty Days of Eastertide (from Easter Day to the Day of Pentecost)
should be celebrated throughout the season and not displaced by other celebrations.
Except for a patronal or dedication festival, no festival may displace the celebration of Sunday as a
memorial of the resurrection, and no saint’s day may be celebrated in Easter Week.
The nine days after Ascension Day until Pentecost may be used as days of prayer and preparation to
celebrate the outpouring of the Spirit.
Festivals/Ngā Rā Whakamaharatanga o te hunga tapu i ngā Karaipiture
Provision is made for a Number of Festivals to be observed and these are indicated in bold lower case.
These days are not usually displaced and for each day there is full liturgical provision for the Eucharist
and for Morning and Evening Prayer. Provision is also made for a first Evening Prayer on the day before
the festival where this is required.
Festivals falling on a Sunday may be kept on that day or transferred to the Monday or next suitable
weekday and an appropriate indication is given in The Lectionary.
Local celebrations /Ngā Rā Whakamaharatanga o ia Rohe
Patronal festival
The celebration of the patron saint or the title of a church is kept either as a festival or as a principal
feast. For a Patronal Festival (e.g. St John, All Saints, etc) or Feast of Title (e.g. Holy Trinity), reference
should be made to the appropriate day in the Church year.
Dedication Festival
The Dedication Festival of a church is the anniversary of the date of its dedication or consecration. This
is kept either as a festival or as a principal feast.
If the date is unknown, it may be celebrated on the first Sunday in October, or on the Last Sunday after
Pentecost, or on a suitable date chosen locally. Please refer to the entry on the first Sunday of October
for suitable readings at the Eucharist. See also FAS.
When kept as a principal feast, the patronal festival may be transferred to the nearest Sunday unless
that day is already a principal feast or one of the following days: the 1st Sunday of Advent, the Baptism
of Christ, the 1st Sunday in Lent, the 5th Sunday in Lent or Palm Sunday.
Anniversary
The following psalms and readings may be suitable for the Anniversary of a parish: First Reading: Gen
28:10-17, 1 Kgs 8:22-30, 1 Chron 29:6-19; Psalms: 42, 43, 84, 122; Second Reading: 1 Pet 2:1-5,9-10;
Gospel: Matt 21:12-16, John 20:19-31. Reference may also be made to the readings appointed for the
feast of the Builders of the Church (September 1).
156
Harvest Thanksgiving
Harvest Thanksgiving may be celebrated on a Sunday and may replace the propers for that day provided
it does not supersede any principal feast or festival. The full Proper including Collects is set out in For
all the Saints.

Lesser festivals/Ētahi atu Rā Hākari
Lesser festivals (listed in the calendar in ANZPB/HKMOA), are observed at the level appropriate to a
particular church. Each is provided with a collect, psalm and readings, which may supercede the collect
of the week and the daily eucharistic lectionary. The daily psalms at the daily offices are not usually
superceded by those for lesser festivals, but at the minister’s discretion psalms and readings for the
Holy Communion may be used in the daily offices. The minister may be selective in the lesser festivals
that are observed, and may also keep some or all of them as ‘commemorations’. When a lesser festival
falls on a principal feast or holy day or on a festival, its celebration is normally omitted for that year,
but, where there is sufficient reason, it may at the discretion of the minister, be celebrated on the
nearest available day.
Commemorations/Ētahi atu Rā Whakamaharatanga
Commemorations, which are listed in the calendar, are made by a mention in prayers of intercession
and thanksgiving. They are not provided with a collect, psalm and readings and do not replace the
usual weekday provision at the Holy Communion or the daily offices. The minister may be selective in
the commemorations that are made. A commemoration may be observed as a lesser festival, with
liturgical provision from the Common of the Saints (printed later).
Days of Self-examination and Special Devotion / Ngā rā e whakaaro ai te tangata ki a ia
anō me ngā īnoi pūmau.
The weekdays of Lent and every Friday in the year are days of self-examination and special devotion.
The exceptions are all principal feasts and festivals outside Lent, and Fridays from Easter Day to
Pentecost. These days are all indicated in The Lectionary. The eves of principal feasts are also
appropriately kept as days of self-examination and special devotion in preparation for the feast.
ANZPB/HKMOA provides for vigils or preparation for certain major feasts.
Days of Prayer for the Ministry of the Church and Ordinands [Ember Days]
/Ngā rā īnoi mōte mahi minita i roto i te Hāhi me te hunga i karangatia hei minita
There are two occasions in the year when the Church is encouraged to pray for the ministry of the
Church. These are: (a) weekdays following the Day of Pentecost; (b) the week preceding St Andrew's
Day. Eucharistic readings are provided and are shown at the beginning of each of these seasons. Days
of Prayer for the Ministry of the Church and Ordinands (Ember Days) should be kept, under the bishop‘s
directions, in the week before an ordination as days of prayer for those to be ordained. Ember days
may also be kept even when there is no ordination in the episcopal unit as more general days of prayer
for those who serve the Church in its various ministries, both ordained and lay, and for vocations. For
All the Saints provides a Proper with two sets of Collects: (a) for Deacons, Priests and those to be
ordained; and (b) for lay ministers with particular ministries in the Church.
A New Beginning in Ministry
Reference should also be made to the material provided in For All the Saints for A New Beginning in
Ministry. This is especially suitable in recognising a new ministry in a parish or other setting.
First Reading: Numb 11:16,17,24-29; Ps: 15; 95:1-7; Second Reading: Eph 4:7-16; Gospel: Luke 12:35-

Days of Prayer for Industry, Science and Technology/Ngā īnoi mō ngā wāhi mahi, taha
taiao, pūtaiao taha tangata.
These are days in the month of May and provide an opportunity for prayers to be offered for God’s
guidance for those involved in Industry, Science and Technology.
Days of Prayer for the Care of Creation [Rogation Days]/Ngā rā īnoi kia tiakina ngā mea
katoa i hanga
These days on either side of the commemoration of St Francis of Assisi (October 4) provide opportunities
for prayer to be offered for God’s blessing on the fruits and creatures of the earth, and the stewardship
of the environment. The readings are set out in October. Collects are in FAS p.511.
Ordinary Time / He wā noa iho
Ordinary time is the period after the feast of the Presentation of Christ until Shrove Tuesday; and from
the day after the feast of Pentecost until the day before the first Sunday of Advent. During ordinary
time, there is no seasonal emphasis, except that the period between All Saints’ Day and the First Sunday
of Advent is observed as a time to celebrate and reflect upon the reign of Christ in earth and heaven.
Thanksgiving for Holy Communion: Refer to Corpus Christi (Thursday after Trinity Sunday).

emphasis is given to the day itself rather than to the commemoration of certain individuals. The
necessary references are made on each of the days involved. Details of the psalms and readings for
these days are shown in the week in which each is normally commemorated.
158
LITURGICAL COLOURS
General Synod makes the following provisions for Liturgical Colours. The suggested colour for the day
is shown at the left of each day's entry under the date. The colours for a Sunday or major feast or
holy day are shown with a capital letter. The colours for lesser holy days are indicated in lower case.
The colour for a particular service should reflect the predominant theme. If the collect, readings, etc
on a lesser festival are those of the saint, then either red (for a martyr) or white is used; otherwise,
the colour of the season is retained. The colour for a 1st Evensong is shown below the colour for the
day.
W (White) is the colour for the festal periods
• from Christmas Day to the Presentation
and
• from Easter Day to Ascension Day
• Trinity Sunday
• Festivals of Our Lord and the Blessed
Virgin Mary
• All Saints’ Day
• Festivals of those saints not venerated as
martyrs
• The Feast of Dedication of a church
• At Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday
• Thanksgiving for Holy Communion and
Holy Baptism
It is used for Marriages
It is used for Baptisms.
It may be used in preference to violet or black
for Funerals and should be used at the Funeral
of a Child.
R (Red) is used:
• During Holy Week (except for Holy
Communion on Maundy Thursday)
• From the Friday after Ascension Day to
the Feast of Pentecost
• Feasts of those saints venerated as
martyrs.
It may be used between All Saints’ Day and the
eve of the First Sunday of Advent (except
where other provision is made). This is
indicated in brackets [R] during this period.
It is appropriate for any services which focus
on the gift of the Holy Spirit, and is therefore
suitable for Confirmation and Ordination.
V (Violet) is the colour for:
• Advent
• From Ash Wednesday until the day before
Palm Sunday.
It may be used for Funerals and for
Commemoration of the Faithful Departed,
although either black or white may be
preferred.
A Lent array of unbleached linen is sometimes
used as an alternative to violet, but only from
Ash Wednesday until the day before Palm
Sunday.
G (Green) is used
• from the day after the Presentation until
Shrove Tuesday
• from the day after Pentecost until the eve
of All Saints’ Day,
except when other provision is made.
Other practices
which can be noted are:
• Removal of coloured hangings on Good
Friday and Easter Eve.
Other practices in addition to those
commended by General Synod:
• The use of Gold for feasts of our Lord and
of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
• The use of Blue for the Blessed Virgin
Mary and the Angels.
The English sequence
Where a parish uses the "English sequence",
the following suggestions may be helpful:
• W will mean the 'Best' or White or Gold
for Feasts of our Lord and of the Blessed
Virgin Mary. Yellow for Birth of St John
Baptist, Mary Magdalene, saints who are
not martyrs.
• V will mean: Violet (rather than Purple) or
Blue (which is liturgically the same as
Purple) for Advent, Septuagesima to
Shrove Tuesday, Vigils, Ember days,
Rogation days.
• Lenten colour (resembling unbleached
linen) from Ash Wednesday to
Refreshment Sunday.
• Passiontide Red (a deep blood red) from
Passion Sunday to Maundy Thursday.

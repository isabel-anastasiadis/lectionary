Rules when Naming of Jesus and baptism of christ fall on a Sunday (happen at the same time)
- When the Festival of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to Monday 2 January, the Sunday is kept as the Second Sunday of Christmas but the provision for the First Sunday of Christmas is used.
- When the baptism of christ falls on a Sunday and the epiphany is celebrated on that sunday instead of the actual day, then the baptism of christ is pushed to Mon 9th.
- I think this is because you can either celebrate feast days on their proper day, or shift them if they fall on a Sunday, 
  and I'm keeping it simple by not shifting.  So until I want to make it more comprehensive, don't need to do anything here.
- Both affect 2023/01/01

When epiphany falls on a Sunday (it is usually before Sunday), then the other readings shuffle later by one week, 
   and the last one (4th Sunday after ephiph) goes on the 3rd of Feb.
- Last happened 2019, won't happen for ages

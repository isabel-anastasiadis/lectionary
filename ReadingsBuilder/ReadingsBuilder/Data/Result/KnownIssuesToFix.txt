Rules when Naming of Jesus and baptism of christ fall on a Sunday (happen at the same time)
- When the Festival of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to Monday 2 January, the Sunday is kept as the Second Sunday of Christmas but the provision for the First Sunday of Christmas is used.
- When the baptism of christ falls on a Sunday and the epiphany is celebrated on that sunday instead of the actual day, then the baptism of christ is pushed to Mon 9th.
- I think this is because you can either celebrate feast days on their proper day, or shift them if they fall on a Sunday, 
  and I'm keeping it simple by not shifting.  So until I want to make it more comprehensive, don't need to do anything here.
- Both affect 2023/01/01

When epiphany falls on a Sunday (it is usually before Sunday), then the other readings shuffle later by one week, 
   and the last one (4th Sunday after ephiph) goes on the 3rd of Feb.
- Last happened 2019, won't happen for ages


Somehow in 2023, the first EP of Trinity Sunday data got applied on Sunday evening, not Sat evening???
Also need to make sure that the Trinity Sunday EP gives way to the Barnabas EP (in 2023, they happened to be the same day)

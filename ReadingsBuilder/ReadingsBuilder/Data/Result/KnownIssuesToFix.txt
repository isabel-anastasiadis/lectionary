Rules when Naming of Jesus and baptism of christ fall on a Sunday (happen at the same time)
- When the Festival of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to Monday 2 January, the Sunday is kept as the Second Sunday of Christmas but the provision for the First Sunday of Christmas is used.
- When the baptism of christ falls on a Sunday and the epiphany is celebrated on that sunday instead of the actual day, then the baptism of christ is pushed to Mon 9th.
- I think this is because you can either celebrate feast days on their proper day, or shift them if they fall on a Sunday, 
  and I'm keeping it simple by not shifting.  So until I want to make it more comprehensive, don't need to do anything here.
- Both affect 2023/01/01

When epiphany falls on a Sunday (it is usually before Sunday), then the other readings shuffle later by one week, 
   and the last one (4th Sunday after ephiph) goes on the 3rd of Feb.
- Last happened 2019, won't happen for ages


How far I've checked dates:
- Need to recheck Holy week - RCL has rcl throughout the week, so really need to implement options!
- Need to check sundays after the 24th March once we have RCL options
- Otherwise, we have checked until normal days until the 8th June 2024.


Issues:

	18 May - missing MP psalm
	25th May - 1st ep has Exod 34:1-10 in the lectionary, but we have Isaiah??
	29 May - Do we do Corpus cristi? Day of thanksgiving for holy communion
	30 may - Corpus christi?

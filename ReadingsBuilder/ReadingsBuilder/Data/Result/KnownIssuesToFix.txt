2. Rules when Naming of Jesus falls on a Sunday (still don't understand the rules here)
- When the Festival of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to Monday 2 January, the Sunday is kept as the Second Sunday of Christmas but the provision for the First Sunday of Christmas is used.

3. Sundays between Ephiphany and 2nd Sun before Lent start from the beginning of the list of readings, and miss later ones (whereas weekday lectionary have a list they work backwards from).
So this needs to be done in a new ruleset to be correct.
- All years

4. Special RCL for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Presentation of Christ


5. When epiphany falls on a Sunday (it is usually before Sunday), then the other readings shuffle later by one week, and the last one (4th Sunday after ephiph) goes on the 3rd of Feb.
